# Change Log

## 1.0.2
Adds the concept of a key for both an application and application instance. This means applications can be
uniquely identified and application instances are able to automatically generate a domain based on their
relationship with a site and application.

## 1.0.1
Adds ability to do OAuth with a site id as well as a oauth_consumer_key

## 1.0.0
Channels all OAuth requests through a single domain. The applications root domain will be used in combination with
the value defined by "oauth_subdomain" in secrets.yml. i.e. <oauth_subdomain>.<application_root_domain>
